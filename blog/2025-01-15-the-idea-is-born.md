# The Idea is Born - Creating a New AI Coding Era

Hi, I'm Davor Radic, and I'm embarking on an exciting journey that I want to share with you.

## My Story

I'm a Master's student in Applied AI at IU International University of Applied Sciences, and I work as an educator in the Software Development team at ROC Nijmegen. For my master's thesis, I'm researching something that affects all of us in tech: **How do we learn to code in the age of AI?**

## The Big Question

Every day, I see students struggling with a fundamental question: *"Should I learn to code the traditional way, or should I use AI tools from the start?"* Educators are confused. Industry is unsure. And students? They're caught in the middle.

This confusion inspired my research question:

**"What is the best coding workflow when AI tools are available? Which tools should we use, and when?"**

## Why This Matters

We're at a crossroads in programming education. AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude are changing how we write code. But nobody knows:

- What skills are still essential?
- What can AI handle for us?
- How do we teach this effectively?
- What's the most productive workflow?

## The Research Approach

For my master's thesis, I'm doing something different. Instead of just theorizing, I'm creating a **2-day hackathon** where we'll:

1. **Record actual coding workflows** - 1-hour sessions captured on video
2. **Use AI to analyze the recordings** - Computer vision extracts patterns automatically
3. **Learn together** - Students, educators, and industry professionals sharing insights
4. **Share the results openly** - All research available for free

## What We'll Discover

By analyzing how people actually use AI tools while coding, we'll learn:

- Which workflows are most effective
- When to use AI vs manual coding
- How much time AI saves (or doesn't)
- What tools work best for different tasks
- Best practices for AI-assisted development

## Everyone Benefits

This isn't just academic research. Here's how everyone profits:

**Students:** Learn the most effective coding workflows backed by data

**Educators:** Understand what to teach in the AI era

**Industry:** Discover how to hire and train AI-proficient developers

**Researchers:** Get open data to build upon

## Join the Movement

This research is completely open source. All findings, methodologies, and insights will be freely available. Whether you're a student, educator, industry professional, or researcher - you can participate or use the results.

**The hackathon is coming soon.** We'll record workflows, analyze patterns, and discover together what works best in this new AI coding era.

## Let's Learn Together

I believe we're creating a new way of coding - not replacing programmers with AI, but finding the perfect collaboration between human creativity and AI efficiency.

This is my master's thesis, but it's bigger than that. It's about shaping how programming education evolves for the next generation.

Want to be part of this journey? Stay tuned. The best coding workflows are about to be discovered.
