# Obsolete Skills (Below the Border)

## ‚ùå Knowledge That May Become Obsolete

Our research hypothesis suggests these skills may fall "below the border" - tasks that AI can handle more effectively than humans, allowing educators to focus time on more essential areas.

## üìù Syntax Memorization

### Language-Specific Details
- **Syntax Rules**: Specific formatting requirements for different languages
- **Function Signatures**: Memorizing parameter orders and return types
- **Library APIs**: Remembering exact method names and usage patterns
- **Framework Specifics**: Detailed knowledge of framework conventions

### Code Templates and Boilerplate
- **Standard Patterns**: Common code structures and implementations
- **Configuration Files**: Setup and initialization code
- **Import Statements**: Managing dependencies and module loading
- **Error Handling Boilerplate**: Standard exception handling patterns

## üìö Documentation Heavy Lifting

### Manual Reference Lookup
- **API Documentation Reading**: Parsing extensive technical documentation
- **Library Exploration**: Manually discovering available functions and classes
- **Framework Learning**: Absorbing large amounts of framework-specific knowledge
- **Version Compatibility Research**: Tracking changes across software versions

### Information Gathering Tasks
- **Stack Overflow Browsing**: Hunting for solutions to common problems
- **Tutorial Following**: Step-by-step implementation guides
- **Example Code Adaptation**: Modifying found code for specific needs
- **Best Practice Research**: Finding recommended approaches for common tasks

## üîÑ Repetitive Implementation

### CRUD Operations
- **Database Operations**: Standard create, read, update, delete implementations
- **Form Handling**: Basic input validation and processing
- **Authentication Flows**: Standard login/logout/registration patterns
- **API Endpoints**: Basic REST or GraphQL endpoint creation

### UI Component Creation
- **Standard Components**: Buttons, forms, lists, modals
- **Layout Patterns**: Common responsive design implementations
- **Styling Boilerplate**: Basic CSS for common design patterns
- **Interactive Elements**: Standard JavaScript event handling

## üêõ Basic Debugging

### Mechanical Error Finding
- **Syntax Error Location**: Finding missing semicolons, brackets, etc.
- **Type Mismatch Detection**: Identifying basic data type conflicts
- **Undefined Variable Catching**: Spotting variable name typos
- **Logic Error Patterns**: Common algorithmic mistakes

### Routine Testing Tasks
- **Unit Test Boilerplate**: Standard test structure creation
- **Test Data Generation**: Creating sample data for testing
- **Assertion Writing**: Basic validation statements
- **Coverage Analysis**: Mechanical measurement of test completeness

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Setup

### Environment Configuration
- **Development Environment Setup**: Installing and configuring tools
- **Package Management**: Routine dependency installation and updates
- **Build Script Creation**: Standard compilation and deployment scripts
- **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Basic automation configuration

### Deployment Mechanics
- **Server Configuration**: Standard web server setup
- **Database Setup**: Routine database installation and configuration
- **Container Creation**: Basic Docker and containerization tasks
- **Cloud Resource Provisioning**: Standard cloud service setup

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Caveats

### Context Dependency
Some skills may be obsolete in AI-assisted environments but remain important in:
- **High-security contexts** where AI tools aren't permitted
- **Legacy systems** where AI training data is limited
- **Specialized domains** with unique requirements
- **Educational contexts** where understanding fundamentals matters

### Skill Transfer Value
Even "obsolete" skills may provide:
- **Conceptual foundation** for understanding AI-generated solutions
- **Debugging capabilities** when AI solutions don't work
- **Communication skills** for explaining problems to AI tools
- **Quality assessment** abilities for evaluating AI output

### Evolution Uncertainty
Skill obsolescence depends on:
- **AI tool capabilities** continuing to improve
- **Industry adoption** of AI-assisted development
- **Regulatory requirements** that may limit AI usage
- **Economic factors** affecting tool accessibility

## üéØ Research Validation Goals

Our hackathon will test these hypotheses by:
- **Measuring efficiency** of AI tools vs. human implementation for these tasks
- **Assessing quality** of AI-generated vs. human-created solutions
- **Observing learning curves** for different participant groups
- **Identifying edge cases** where human knowledge remains essential

The goal isn't to eliminate these skills entirely, but to understand when focusing on them provides diminishing educational returns compared to developing essential human capabilities.
