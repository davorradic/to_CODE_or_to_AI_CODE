# Participant Groups

Our research design includes six distinct participant categories, each representing a different stage of programming knowledge and AI tool familiarity. This stratification allows us to map the complete spectrum of programming education needs.

## üå± The Blank Slate Coders

### Profile: Complete Programming Beginners
- ‚úÖ Zero programming experience
- ‚úÖ Never written a line of code
- ‚úÖ Basic computer literacy only
- ‚úÖ Fresh perspective on AI-assisted development

### Research Target
**What absolute minimum knowledge enables AI collaboration?**

This group helps us understand the theoretical floor of programming knowledge. Can someone with zero coding experience use AI tools effectively? What basic concepts must they grasp first?

### Expected Insights
- Minimum conceptual understanding required for AI partnership
- Most effective learning pathways from zero to functional
- Critical knowledge gaps that prevent AI collaboration
- Natural intuition vs. learned programming concepts

---

## üîç The Code Curious

### Profile: Programming Enthusiasts
- ‚úÖ Watched tutorials and online courses
- ‚úÖ Tried coding 1-3 times but never finished projects
- ‚úÖ Understands basic concepts but lacks hands-on experience
- ‚úÖ Motivated to learn but intimidated by traditional coding

### Research Target
**Does theoretical knowledge translate to AI-assisted success?**

This group tests whether passive learning (videos, articles) provides sufficient foundation for AI-assisted development, or if hands-on experience remains essential.

### Expected Insights
- Gap between theoretical understanding and practical application
- How AI tools bridge knowledge-to-implementation barriers
- Most common misconceptions from tutorial-based learning
- Effectiveness of AI as a "practice partner"

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Traditional Builders

### Profile: Experienced Developers
- ‚úÖ 1-3 years of hands-on programming
- ‚úÖ Built 3+ complete applications from scratch
- ‚úÖ Strong traditional coding workflows
- ‚úÖ Minimal AI tool experience

### Research Target
**Which traditional skills remain essential vs. become obsolete?**

This group provides our control baseline - developers who learned programming the "traditional" way. We can identify which of their hard-earned skills remain valuable in the AI era.

### Expected Insights
- Traditional skills that enhance AI collaboration
- Workflows that become obsolete or counterproductive
- Adaptation patterns from traditional to AI-assisted development
- Skills that transfer vs. skills that must be unlearned

---

## ü§ñ The AI Natives

### Profile: AI-First Developers
- ‚úÖ 6 months - 1 year using AI coding tools
- ‚úÖ Built projects primarily with AI assistance
- ‚úÖ Comfortable with prompt engineering
- ‚úÖ Limited traditional "from scratch" experience

### Research Target
**What happens when AI tools are the primary learning method?**

This group represents the future of programming education - developers who learned primarily through AI assistance. What are their strengths and blind spots?

### Expected Insights
- Unique capabilities of AI-native developers
- Knowledge gaps from AI-dependent learning
- Strengths in AI collaboration and prompt crafting
- Weaknesses when AI tools are unavailable or insufficient

---

## üéì The Hybrid Learners

### Profile: AI-Traditional Bridge
- ‚úÖ Traditional programming background (2+ years)
- ‚úÖ Actively using AI tools for 6+ months
- ‚úÖ Experience in both coding paradigms
- ‚úÖ Can compare effectiveness of both approaches

### Research Target
**What's the optimal balance between traditional and AI skills?**

This group provides our "ideal" comparison - developers who understand both paradigms and can articulate the benefits and limitations of each approach.

### Expected Insights
- Optimal integration patterns for AI tools
- Which traditional skills enhance AI collaboration
- Most effective transition strategies
- Best practices for hybrid development workflows

---

## üè¢ The Industry Veterans

### Profile: Senior Developers & Team Leads
- ‚úÖ 5+ years professional development experience
- ‚úÖ Currently working at tech companies
- ‚úÖ Team leadership and mentoring experience
- ‚úÖ Perspective on industry hiring and skill requirements

### Research Target
**What skills do companies actually need in the AI era?**

This group provides real-world industry context - what skills are actually valued in professional development environments?

### Expected Insights
- Industry skill requirements vs. educational priorities
- Professional development workflow adaptations
- Team leadership in AI-integrated environments
- Long-term career implications of AI-assisted development

---

## üìä Participant Distribution Strategy

### Balanced Representation
- **Equal team sizes** within each group for AI vs. traditional approaches
- **Diverse backgrounds** within groups (different industries, educational paths)
- **Mixed experience levels** to capture within-group variations

### Target Numbers
- **24-30 participants per group** (12-15 AI-assisted, 12-15 traditional)
- **Total: 144-180 participants**
- **6 company challenges** with mixed teams

### Selection Criteria
- **Self-assessment accuracy** verified through practical evaluation
- **Commitment to full 4-day participation**
- **Diverse demographic representation**
- **Geographic distribution** (when possible)

This participant structure ensures comprehensive data collection across the complete spectrum of programming knowledge and AI readiness, providing robust insights for educational institutions worldwide.
