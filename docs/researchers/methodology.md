## üéØ Simple Approach

**1-hour hackathon** ‚Üí **Screen recording** ‚Üí **AI analysis** ‚Üí **Learn best workflows together**

### What We Want to Know
- How do people use AI in their coding workflow?
- What makes a good AI-assisted programming workflow?
- When should you use AI vs code manually?

## üìä What Data We Collect

From 1-hour screen recordings, we automatically extract:

### Activity Tracking
- Which applications you use (VS Code, ChatGPT, browser, etc.)
- How much time in each application
- When you switch between tools

### Coding Patterns
- When you type code manually vs use AI
- How you use AI prompts
- Copy-paste behavior from AI to your code
- Problem-solving approaches

### Example Data Points
**Typical 1-hour session:**
- 45% time in IDE coding
- 20% using AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot)
- 15% reading documentation
- 20% debugging and testing

**What makes a good workflow:**
- Strategic AI use for repetitive tasks
- Manual coding for core logic
- Quick problem-solving with AI assistance
- Code review of AI suggestions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Tools & Libraries We Use

**Video Processing:**
```bash
# Open source (free)
pip install opencv-python
pip install pytesseract
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
```

**AI Analysis Options:**

#### Option 1: Free (Tesseract OCR)
- 85-90% accuracy
- Runs on your computer
- Completely free
- Good for learning and testing

#### Option 2: Paid (Azure AI Vision)
- 95%+ accuracy
- Cloud-based processing
- ~$1-3 per 1000 recordings
- Professional quality

### How It Works

**Step 1: Record**
- Use OBS Studio or similar
- Record 1-hour coding session
- Upload video file

**Step 2: AI Processes Video**
```python
# Extract frames every 30 seconds
video = cv2.VideoCapture("recording.mp4")
# Use OCR to read screen text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(frame)
# Detect applications, code, AI usage
```

**Step 3: Generate Insights**
- Which apps you used when
- Manual typing vs AI-generated code
- Time spent on different activities
- Your workflow pattern

## üî¨ Scientific Approach

### Research Quality Standards

**Mixed-Methods Research Design:**
- **Quantitative**: Time-based metrics, application usage statistics, code quality measures
- **Qualitative**: Workflow patterns, decision-making processes, problem-solving strategies
- **Validity**: Cross-validation with manual verification on 10% sample

**Data Quality Measures:**
- **Reliability**: Consistent OCR accuracy validation (90%+ threshold)
- **Reproducibility**: Documented methodology with open-source code
- **Statistical Significance**: Minimum sample size calculations for generalizable results
- **Ethics Compliance**: IRB approval, GDPR compliance, participant consent

**Measurement Validation:**
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: Multiple reviewers validate automated analysis
- **Ground Truth Comparison**: Self-reported data vs automated detection
- **Temporal Consistency**: Logical workflow progression verification
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical methods to identify and handle anomalies

### Scientific Metrics We Measure

**Behavioral Metrics (Objective):**
- Application usage time (seconds, milliseconds precision)
- Keystroke timing patterns (natural typing vs paste events)
- Window switching frequency (context switches per minute)
- Code complexity scores (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index)

**Performance Metrics (Quantitative):**
- Task completion rate (percentage of features implemented)
- Error density (bugs per 100 lines of code)
- Code quality scores (automated linting, best practices)
- Problem-solving speed (time to resolution for specific tasks)

**Cognitive Load Indicators (Derived):**
- Pause duration analysis (thinking time vs action time)
- Tool-seeking behavior frequency (help-seeking patterns)
- Trial-and-error iterations (attempt count before success)
- Documentation consultation depth (time spent reading docs)

## üìÖ Research Timeline

### Simple 1-Hour Process

**Data Collection**:
- Students participate in 1-hour hackathon coding session
- Screen recordings automatically captured during session
- Students upload their video recordings to platform

**Automated Analysis**:
- AI computer vision processes all video recordings
- Automated extraction of:
  - Code workflow patterns
  - AI tool usage metrics
  - Typing vs AI-generated code patterns
  - Application switching behavior
  - Problem-solving approaches
  - Time allocation across different activities

**Quality Assurance**:
- 10% sample manually validated for accuracy
- Statistical analysis for significance testing
- Peer review of methodology and findings
- Reproducible research practices with published code

**No Manual Processing Required** - All data analysis is automated using AI-powered video analysis
