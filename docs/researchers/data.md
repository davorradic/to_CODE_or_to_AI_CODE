# Research Data Framework

## üìä What Data We Collect

### From Screen Recordings
- Code activity and workflow patterns
- AI tool usage (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- Application switching behavior
- Typing vs AI-generated code

### Performance Data
- Code quality metrics
- Task completion rates
- Error patterns and debugging approaches
- Problem-solving speed

## üîí Privacy & Ethics

### Your Data is Protected
- **Anonymized**: All personal information removed
- **Secure**: Encrypted storage with access controls
- **Consent**: Clear agreement before participation
- **Your Rights**: Access, correction, and withdrawal anytime

### Compliance
- GDPR compliant (European data protection)
- IRB approved (ethics review)
- Research-only use

## üìà How We Analyze Data

**Simple Approach:**
- Count and measure objective behaviors (time, clicks, switches)
- Find patterns in workflows (what works best)
- Compare different approaches (AI-heavy vs balanced)
- Learn together what makes effective coding workflows

## ü§ù Open Research

### Data Sharing
- Anonymized datasets available for academic use
- Methodology fully documented
- Support for replication studies
