# To Code or to AI Code Research

üé≠ **"What Should Students Still Learn vs. What Can AI Handle?"**

Welcome to the comprehensive research documentation for the **"To Code or to AI Code" Hackathon 2026** - a groundbreaking study that aims to reshape programming education for the AI era.

## üî¨ Core Research Question

**"Where is the border between essential programming knowledge that students must learn versus skills that can be effectively delegated to AI tools?"**

This research is part of an Applied AI thesis project at [IU International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.org/masters/artificial-intelligence/), designed to create open-source research that benefits educational institutions worldwide.

## üåç Open Source Vision

This research framework and all findings will be made freely available to schools, universities, and educational organizations globally. We believe that advancing programming education in the AI era should be a collaborative effort that benefits everyone.

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate

Whether you're an educator, researcher, or institution interested in AI-assisted programming education, we invite you to join this research initiative. Together, we can reshape how programming is taught in the age of artificial intelligence.

## üìñ Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

- **Research Overview**: Core methodology, research questions, and participant groups
- **Event Details**: Timeline, challenges, and TEDx component details
