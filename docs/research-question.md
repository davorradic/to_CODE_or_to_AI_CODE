# Core Research Question

## üéØ The Central Question

**"Where is the border between essential programming knowledge that students must learn versus skills that can be effectively delegated to AI tools?"**

This question sits at the heart of our research and represents one of the most critical challenges facing programming education today.

## üåç Why This Matters

### For Educational Institutions
- **Curriculum Optimization**: Understand what to teach vs. what AI can handle
- **Resource Allocation**: Focus teaching efforts on truly essential skills
- **Future-Proofing**: Prepare students for an AI-integrated development world

### For Students
- **Efficient Learning**: Master skills that remain valuable in the AI era
- **Career Preparation**: Understand how to collaborate effectively with AI
- **Competitive Advantage**: Develop irreplaceable human capabilities

### For Industry
- **Hiring Decisions**: Identify which skills to prioritize in candidates
- **Training Programs**: Design effective AI-integrated development workflows
- **Team Composition**: Balance human expertise with AI capabilities

## üîç Sub-Research Questions

Our investigation explores several key dimensions:

### 1. Knowledge Levels
- What **minimum conceptual understanding** enables effective AI collaboration?
- How does **theoretical knowledge** translate to AI-assisted development success?
- Which **fundamental concepts** remain essential regardless of AI tools?

### 2. Skill Categories
- **Syntax & Implementation**: What can AI fully handle vs. what requires human oversight?
- **Problem Decomposition**: How do humans and AI complement each other in breaking down complex problems?
- **Quality Assurance**: What critical thinking skills are irreplaceable in code review and debugging?

### 3. Experience Levels
- How does **prior programming experience** affect AI collaboration effectiveness?
- What happens when **AI-first learners** encounter complex problems?
- Can **traditional developers** adapt their skills to AI-integrated workflows?

## üìä Expected Research Outcomes

### The "Border Map"
We aim to create a comprehensive map showing:
- **Above the Border**: Essential human knowledge and skills
- **Below the Border**: Tasks that can be effectively delegated to AI
- **Gray Areas**: Skills that require human-AI collaboration

### Practical Applications
- **Educational Frameworks**: Curriculum recommendations for different student levels
- **Assessment Methods**: How to evaluate student readiness for AI-assisted development
- **Industry Guidelines**: Best practices for integrating AI tools in development teams

## üéì Academic Contribution

This research contributes to the emerging field of **AI-Assisted Programming Education** by:
- Providing empirical data on skill essentiality
- Creating frameworks for educational decision-making
- Establishing benchmarks for AI collaboration effectiveness
- Publishing open-source methodologies for global adoption
