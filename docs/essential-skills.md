# Essential Skills (Above the Border)

## ‚úÖ Knowledge That Remains Essential

Based on our research hypothesis and preliminary studies, these skills represent the "above the border" knowledge that students must still learn, even in an AI-dominated development landscape.

## üß† Conceptual Understanding

### Core Programming Concepts
- **Variable and Data Types**: Understanding what data represents and how it flows
- **Control Flow**: Comprehending loops, conditionals, and program execution paths
- **Functions and Scope**: Grasping modular programming and data isolation
- **Object-Oriented Thinking**: Understanding entities, relationships, and inheritance

### System Architecture Awareness
- **Application Structure**: How components interact and communicate
- **Database Relationships**: Data modeling and query logic
- **API Concepts**: How services communicate and share data
- **Security Principles**: Understanding vulnerabilities and protection strategies

## ü§ù AI Collaboration Skills

### Prompt Engineering Mastery
- **Clear Communication**: Writing precise, unambiguous requirements
- **Context Provision**: Giving AI tools sufficient background information
- **Iterative Refinement**: Improving prompts based on AI responses

## üîÆ Future-Proofing Considerations

These essential skills are designed to remain valuable regardless of how AI tools evolve:

- **Human-AI Collaboration** will always require human judgment and oversight
- **Creative Problem-Solving** involves innovation beyond pattern matching
- **Ethical Decision-Making** requires human values and contextual understanding
- **Strategic Thinking** involves goals and priorities that AI cannot determine independently

Our research aims to validate these hypotheses and provide concrete evidence for educational institutions to make informed curriculum decisions.
