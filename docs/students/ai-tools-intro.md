- [ ] Prepare questions for mentors and judges

## üí° Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

### Do's ‚úÖ
- **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts get better results
- **Iterate**: Refine your requests based on AI responses
- **Verify**: Always test and review AI-generated code
- **Learn**: Ask AI to explain its solutions
- **Document**: Keep track of what AI tools you used and why

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Don't Blindly Copy**: Always understand the code you use
- **Don't Skip Testing**: AI code can have subtle bugs
- **Don't Over-Rely**: Maintain your own problem-solving skills
- **Don't Ignore Errors**: AI doesn't always handle edge cases
- **Don't Forget Security**: Review AI code for security issues

## üé® Effective Prompting Techniques

### Structure Your Requests
```
Context: "I'm building a web application for students to track assignments"
Task: "Create a JavaScript function that..."
Constraints: "Use vanilla JavaScript, no external libraries"
Format: "Include error handling and comments"
```

### Progressive Prompting
1. Start with high-level requirements
2. Refine with specific details
3. Ask for improvements or alternatives
4. Request explanations for complex parts

### Code Review Prompts
- "Review this code for potential bugs"
- "Suggest improvements for readability"
- "How can I make this more efficient?"
- "What edge cases am I missing?"

## üîç Quality Assessment Framework

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- [ ] **Readability**: Can you and others understand it?
- [ ] **Efficiency**: Is it reasonably optimized?
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Can it be easily modified?
- [ ] **Security**: Are there obvious vulnerabilities?

### AI Collaboration Evaluation
- [ ] **Appropriate Usage**: Used AI for suitable tasks?
- [ ] **Critical Thinking**: Evaluated AI suggestions thoughtfully?
- [ ] **Understanding**: Can you explain how the code works?
- [ ] **Independence**: Could you modify it without AI help?

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### AI Tool Problems
**Issue**: AI generates non-functional code
**Solution**: Provide more context, break down complex requests, verify step-by-step

**Issue**: AI suggestions don't fit your project
**Solution**: Be more specific about requirements, provide examples, iterate on prompts

**Issue**: Over-dependence on AI assistance
**Solution**: Practice coding without AI regularly, focus on understanding concepts

### Technical Problems
**Issue**: IDE integration not working
**Solution**: Check plugin versions, restart IDE, verify account authentication

**Issue**: Slow AI response times
**Solution**: Use simpler prompts, try different times of day, have backup tools ready

**Issue**: Code conflicts between different AI tools
**Solution**: Stick to one primary tool per project, maintain consistent coding style
